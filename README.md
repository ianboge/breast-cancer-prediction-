The model is trained using logistic regression

This project implements a breast cancer prediction model using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset of breast cancer cases to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features such as cell size, cell shape, and other relevant medical parameters.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Utilizes logistic regression, a powerful and interpretable classification algorithm.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score.
Visualization: Provides visual representations of the data distribution and model performance.
This project aims to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions by providing a reliable tool for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
